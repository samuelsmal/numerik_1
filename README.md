# Solutions to Numerik 1

These are my own solutions to the lecture *Numerik 1* at the UZH, FS14. Works with Octave and Matlab.

If you find errors, or advice please do fill an issue, or whatnot.

The files are structured as follows:

    [f (function) | s (script) | d (data)]_[exercise number]_[title].m

Corresponding to their use. Is use this to avoid naming like `myfactorial`. And to keep them all in a single directory for ease of use.
