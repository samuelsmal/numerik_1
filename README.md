# Solutions to Numerik 1

These are my own solutions to the lecture *Numerik 1* at the UZH, FS14. Works with Octave and Matlab.

If you find errors, or advice please do fill an issue, or whatnot.

I made sure that these give the same results as the code provided by the TA,
but with different variable names, more functions etc.
I'll iterate over this many times the comming days.

You can view the help for each file (or function) with `help <name_of_the_file>`
